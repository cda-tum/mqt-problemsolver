# Addressing the QCE25 Review Process

The folder "Error_Budget_Optimization" contains the open-source code for the submission "Improving Hardware Requirements for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing by Optimizing Error Budget Distributions" at the QCE 2025. Please note, that the file "RE_experiments.py" is not part of the considered submission. The numpy arrays contain data for the three cases of total error budgets, while the \*.pkl files are the trained models used for the predictions. The "counts_adjusted.csv" file contains the logical counts of the used quantum circuits.
