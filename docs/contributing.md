## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines to help the project grow sustainably.

### Core Guidelines

- ["Commit early and push often"](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/commit-early-push-often).
- Write meaningful commit messages, preferably using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for additional context.
- Focus on a single feature or bug at a time and only touch relevant files.
  Split multiple features into separate contributions.
- Add tests for new features to ensure they work as intended.
- Document new features.
- Add tests for bug fixes to demonstrate the fix.
- Document your code thoroughly and ensure it is readable.
- Keep your code clean by removing debug statements, leftover comments, and unrelated code.
- Check your code for style and linting errors before committing.
- Follow the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes based on code reviews.

### Pull Request Workflow

- Create PRs early.
  Work-in-progress PRs are welcome; mark them as drafts on GitHub.
- Use a clear title, reference related issues by number, and describe the changes.
  Follow the PR template; only omit the issue reference if not applicable.
- CI runs on all supported platforms and Python versions to build, test, format, and lint.
  All checks must pass before merging.
- When ready, convert the draft to a regular PR and request a review from a maintainer.
  If unsure, ask in PR comments.
  If you are a first-time contributor, mention a maintainer in a comment to request a review.
- If your PR gets a "Changes requested" review, address the feedback and push updates to the same branch.
  Do not close and reopen a new PR.
  Respond to comments to signal that you have addressed the feedback.
  Do not resolve review comments yourself; the reviewer will do so once satisfied.
- Re-request a review after pushing changes that address feedback.
- Do not squash commits locally; maintainers typically squash on merge.
  Avoid rebasing or force-pushing before reviews; you may rebase after addressing feedback if desired.

## Get Started 🎉

Ready to contribute?
We value contributions from people with all levels of experience.
In particular, if this is your first PR, not everything has to be perfect.
We will guide you through the process.

## Installation

Check out our {ref}`installation guide for developers <development-setup>` for instructions on how to set up your development environment.

## Working on the Package

The package lives in the {code}`src/mqt/problemsolver` directory.

We recommend using [{code}`nox`][nox] for development.
{code}`nox` is a Python automation tool that allows you to define tasks in a {code}`noxfile.py` file and then run them with a single command.
If you have not installed it yet, see our {ref}`installation guide for developers <development-setup>`.

We define four convenient {code}`nox` sessions in our {code}`noxfile.py`:

- {code}`tests` to run the Python tests
- {code}`minimums` to run the Python tests with the minimum dependencies
- {code}`lint` to run the Python code formatting and linting
- {code}`docs` to build the documentation

These are explained in more detail in the following sections.

## Running the Tests

The Python code is tested by unit tests using the [{code}`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework.
The corresponding test files can be found in the {code}`tests` directory.
A {code}`nox` session is provided to conveniently run the Python tests.

```console
$ nox -s tests
```

This command automatically builds the project and runs the tests on all supported Python versions.
For each Python version, it will create a virtual environment (in the {code}`.nox` directory) and install the project into it.
We take extra care to install the project without build isolation so that rebuilds are typically very fast.

If you only want to run the tests on a specific Python version, you can pass the desired Python version to the {code}`nox` command.

```console
$ nox -s tests-3.12
```

:::{note}

If you do not want to use {code}`nox`, you can also run the tests directly using {code}`pytest`.
This requires that you have the project and its test dependencies installed in your virtual environment (e.g., by running {code}`uv sync`).

```console
(.venv) $ pytest
```

:::

We provide an additional nox session {code}`minimums` that makes use of {code}`uv`'s {code}`--resolution=lowest-direct` flag to install the lowest possible versions of the direct dependencies.
This ensures that the project can still be built and the tests pass with the minimum required versions of the dependencies.

```console
$ nox -s minimums
```

## Code Formatting and Linting

The Python code is formatted and linted using a collection of [{code}`pre-commit`][pre-commit] hooks.
This collection includes

- [ruff][ruff], an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust, and
- [mypy][mypy], a static type checker for Python code.

The hooks can be installed by running the following command in the root directory:

```console
$ pre-commit install
```

This will install the hooks in the {code}`.git/hooks` directory of the repository.
The hooks will be executed whenever you commit changes.

You can also run the {code}`nox` session {code}`lint` to run the hooks manually.

```console
$ nox -s lint
```

:::{note}

If you do not want to use {code}`nox`, you can also run the hooks manually by using {code}`pre-commit`.

```console
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Documentation

The Python code is documented using [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings).
Every public function, class, and module should have a docstring that explains what it does and how to use it.
{code}`ruff` will check for missing docstrings and will explicitly warn you if you forget to add one.

We heavily rely on [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to document the expected types of function arguments and return values.

The Python API documentation is integrated into the overall documentation that we host on ReadTheDocs using the
[{code}`sphinx-autoapi`](https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension for Sphinx.

(working-on-documentation)=

## Working on the Documentation

The documentation is written in [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (a flavor of Markdown) and built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
The documentation source files can be found in the {code}`docs/` directory.

On top of the API documentation, we provide a set of tutorials and examples that demonstrate how to use the library.
These are written in Markdown using [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which allows executing Python code blocks in the documentation.
The code blocks are executed during the documentation build process, and the output is included in the documentation.
This allows us to provide up-to-date examples and tutorials that are guaranteed to work with the latest version of the library.

You can build the documentation using the {code}`nox` session {code}`docs`.

```console
$ nox -s docs
```

This will install all dependencies for building the documentation in an isolated environment, build the Python package, and then build the documentation.
It will then host the documentation on a local web server for you to view.

:::{note}

If you do not want to use {code}`nox`, you can also build the documentation directly using {code}`sphinx-build`.
This requires that you have the project and its documentation dependencies installed in your virtual environment (e.g., by running {code}`uv sync`).

```console
(.venv) $ sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build
```

The docs can then be found in the {code}`docs/_build` directory.

## Tips for Development

If something goes wrong, the CI pipeline will notify you.
Here are some tips for finding the cause of certain failures:

- If any of the {code}`CI / 🐍 Test` checks fail, this indicates build errors or test failures.
  Look through the respective logs on GitHub for any error or failure messages.

- If any of the {code}`codecov/\*` checks fail, this means that your changes are not appropriately covered by tests or that the overall project coverage decreased too much.
  Ensure that you include tests for all your changes in the PR.

- If the {code}`pre-commit.ci` check fails, some of the {code}`pre-commit` checks failed and could not be fixed automatically by the _pre-commit.ci_ bot.
  The individual log messages frequently provide helpful suggestions on how to fix the warnings.
- If the {code}`docs/readthedocs.org:\*` check fails, the documentation could not be built properly.
  Inspect the corresponding log file for any errors.

## Releasing a New Version

Before releasing a new version, check the GitHub release draft generated by the Release Drafter for unlabelled PRs.
Unlabelled PRs would appear at the top of the release draft below the main heading.
Furthermore, check whether the version number in the release draft is correct.
The version number in the release draft is dictated by the presence of certain labels on the PRs involved in a release.
By default, a patch release will be created.
If any PR has the {code}`minor` or {code}`major` label, a minor or major release will be created, respectively.

:::{note}

Sometimes, Dependabot or Renovate will tag a PR updating a dependency with a {code}`minor` or {code}`major` label because the dependency update itself is a minor or major release.
This does not mean that the dependency update itself is a breaking change for MQT ProblemSolver.
If you are sure that the dependency update does not introduce any breaking changes for MQT ProblemSolver, you can remove the {code}`minor` or {code}`major` label from the PR.
This will ensure that the respective PR does not influence the type of an upcoming release.
